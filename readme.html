<h1 id="the-phone-call">The Phone Call</h1>
<p>The infamous phone call that took place on July 25, 2019 between 9:03 - 9:33 am EDT between the US President Donald J. Trump and the newly elected President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. After revelations from a whistle blower, a memorandum of the phone call was released on September 24, 2019. This phone call led to Donald J. Trump to become the third US President to be impeached.</p>
<p>This repository contains a - text version of the memorandum that was obtained by using OCR - cleaned version of the text memorandum (no edits to the contents of the phone call were made, I only cleaned up artifacts from the conversion process and moved non-phone call related text to spots that I felt made sense) - script used to obtain the text version of the memorandum</p>
<p>The reason that I used OCR to pull the text from the PDF is that the text in the document didn‚Äôt copy and paste very well and the results from the OCR were much better.</p>
<h2 id="an-aside">An Aside</h2>
<p>You‚Äôll note that I use the word ‚Äúmemorandum‚Äù instead of ‚Äútranscript.‚Äù This is because the document given out by the Trump administration is most definitely <strong><em>not</em></strong> a transcript, it is a <strong><em>memorandum</em></strong>. One day after the release of the memorandum (September 25, 2019), Merriam-Webster <a href="https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/1176864243867619334">tweeted</a> the definitions of memorandum and transcript which is pictured below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄòTranscript‚Äô: üéô a typed copy of dictated or recorded material</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄòMemorandum‚Äô: üìù an informal report or message</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Merriam-Webster (September 25, 2019)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason that I make this distinction is because this memorandum is a reconstruction of what was said in the phone call which would make this document <strong>not</strong> a transcript, but a memorandum. Take a look at the CAUTION that is at the bottom of the first page of the document</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation.¬∑ (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty ‚ÄúOfficers and-NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect ‚Äôthe accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation. The word‚Äùinaudible&quot; is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document <em>itself</em> notes that it is ‚Äúnot a verbatim transcript of a discussion.‚Äù</p>
